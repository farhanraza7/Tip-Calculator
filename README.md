Tip Calculator
This site is mainly used to calculate the tip amount of the bill generated after the service. 
The Tip is calculated by entering the amount of bill and the percentage of the bill amount that has to be give as a tip.
I have added a feature in this webpage that if there is a situation that someone want to split the bill among two or more people then the amount of the tip will also be splited between them equally.
To calculate the amount of bill we have to go through several steps as following: 
1- Enter the amount of the total bill.
2- Enter the amount of the percentage that you want to give as a tip.
3- Enter the no of people you want to split the tip between them.
4- Click on the button to calculate.
